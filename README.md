# Heart-Disease-Prediction-project

##  This project is a machine learning application focused on predicting heart disease. It uses a logistic regression model to classify individuals based on health metrics such as cholesterol level, blood pressure, and other medical features. The dataset is analyzed for missing values, structured into features and labels, and then split into training and testing sets. After training, the model's accuracy is evaluated, providing a simple yet effective predictive model for identifying the likelihood of heart disease.

## Project Details:
**Objective: To predict the presence of heart disease based on a dataset containing various health-related metrics.
**Model: Logistic Regression is used to perform classification.


##Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to apply logistic regression to a medical dataset, aiming to classify whether individuals are likely to have heart disease based on features such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and other health indicators.

##Usage Instructions:
 1.Load Dataset: The dataset (/content/heart_disease_data.csv) is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
 2.Data Preprocessing: Includes checking for missing values, basic exploratory analysis, and separating features (X) from the target variable (Y).
 3.Train-Test Split: Data is split into training and testing sets.
 4. Model Training: A logistic regression model is trained on the training set.
 5.Evaluation: The modelâ€™s accuracy is tested on the test data.

 ##Dependencies:
 To run the code, you'll need:
 .Python 3.x
 Libraries:
 .numpy
 .pandas
 .sklearn (for model selection, logistic regression, and evaluation metrics)
